# msr_2024_challenge_gpt
Replication Package for the MSR 2024 Challenge Track about DevGPT Database

This research was done with 2023-10-12 release of DevGPT that can be found on https://github.com/NAIST-SE/DevGPT/tree/main/snapshot_20231012.

For replication, with the 'MSR_Challenge_SingleFile.ipynb' script, we got all metrics for every file individually, there the variable "fileNumber" is used to select each of the JSON who will be used.

For overall metrics, the 'MSR_Challenge_MultiFile.ipynb' file was used.

Normalisation process is inside of both files and can be found below 'Normalisation'.
